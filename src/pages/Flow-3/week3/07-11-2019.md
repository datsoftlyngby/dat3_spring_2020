*Recap on Threads, Futures, Callables and  Asynchronous Rest with Jax-rs*
*We will recap on thread programming as you were introduced to last semester. More specifically we will introduce Callables and Futures in combination with Jax-rs's Asynchronous Server API.*

*We need all this to make endpoints, which, in order to make a response, must communicate with a number of external API's*
