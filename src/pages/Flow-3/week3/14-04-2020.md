## How to prepare for the review(s)

In the class, you are expected to explain how you have implemented an exercise (or a smaller part of a larger exercise) for the class, meant as the starting point for a shared discussion. 

You must add yourself to [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1noHGQrZoH-x5yqB08cZvnx5PV5nXg4AtpcX8L3V7lnw/edit?usp=sharing), with those exercises you would like to present

*You MUST all select 2-3 exercises, and any exercise must not be selected by more than THREE students. Preferably, you should select from both week 1 and 2.*

[:tv: Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qyykFfX8JA) for a short  (4 min.) introduction to how I expect you to prepare for the review. Note: It's originally made for period-1, so I say Monday, but it's still valid.

[See here for the updated description of what we will do](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nYqlC_aVPiYtLQBNxu0E-CaQutqNrTr6T8_j7VUVmLc/edit?usp=sharing)

After the review I will give a short introduction to [CA-3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10_VtLVIdMkVl0hky48_dcnFQ6eilMCIWv52WFSKzBis/edit?usp=sharing), which is what you all have to focus on for the rest of the week.
