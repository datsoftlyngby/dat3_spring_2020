# Topic for today is Futures and Callables in Java       
## Lesson meant to prepare you for making assynchronoues REST endpoints

*Recap on Threads, Futures, Callables and  Asynchronous Rest with Jax-rs*
*We will recap on thread programming as you were introduced to last semester. More specifically we will introduce Callables and Futures in combination with Jax-rs's Asynchronous Server API.*

*We need all this to make endpoints, which, in order to make a response, must communicate with a number of external API's*

### Before this lesson you should:
- :book: [Read page-1 of todays exercises, to see WHY you need todays topics (5 min.)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TlC9z3xx1jXkpIkLwIYK-5lWoaM7hb3REmSIw4uRGTU/edit?usp=sharing)
- :book: [Java Callable Future Example (20 min. should give you time to execute the example)](https://www.journaldev.com/1090/java-callable-future-example)
- :book: [(RED students) Asynchronous REST with JAX-RS (10 min.)](https://eclipse-ee4j.github.io/jersey.github.io/documentation/latest/user-guide.html#d0e9894) (Read until but dont include, section 11.1.1. Asynchronous Server-side Callbacks)
