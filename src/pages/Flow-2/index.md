shortTitle: "Flow2"
title: "ORM, Restful web services and SPA with JS"
--- 
In this flow we will dig deeper into ORM framework with JPA and look at relationships between Entities and more complex queries with JPQL. We will extend our knowledge about Rest with JAX-RS by implementing POST, PUT and DELETE methods along with the GET methods from last flow. Finally we will go much deeper into javascript and look at some of the new features from ES6 and onward. We will also look at how to build Single Page applications with Javascript.
