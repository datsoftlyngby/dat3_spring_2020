# An introduction to Open API
This lecture is not mandatory and is meant as something EXTRA for RED students. You should NOT attend unless you consider yourself red or almost red.

The idea is to introduce OpenAPI, a standard meant to document (+ many other things) a REST API. If you follow on in today's tutorial you will be able to document your CA-2 (and all future REST API's) as done for this sample [Petshop](https://petstore.swagger.io/)

Shit, you might think, that will take a lot of time on top of everything else we have to do for CA-2. 
**Actually not ;-)**

The extra work will all happen today, which will end up with a version of the start code, which are ready to use OpenAPI for documentation. When this is ready, you should actually find that things are simpler, and therefore faster :-)
# Make sure to have this redy for the demo
A new project Cloned from the startcode, and IMPORTANT, checkout this branch `openapi`

This command will clone and checkout the branch, into a folder demoOAS:

`git clone https://github.com/dat3startcode/rest-jpa-devops-startcode.git -b openapi demoOAS`

Have this document open during the Demo [OpenAPI Class Demo (tbd)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z0KXoyjbuBA-eOJkeY3RHvK80aJB_iMX3yCajGuVOZk/edit?usp=sharing)
