## How to prepare for the review(s)

In the class, you are expected to explain how you have implemented an exercise (or a smaller part of a larger exercise) for the class, meant as the starting point for a shared discussion. 

You must add yourself to [this list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10U4TfYb5RqCaZxziDwoiusH3H5p2TjRdezaJMUuSGK8/edit?usp=sharing), with those exercises you would like to present

*You MUST all select 2-3 exercises, and any exercise must not be selected by more than FOUR students.*

[:tv: Watch this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qyykFfX8JA) for a short  (4 min.) introduction to how I expect you to prepare for the review.

After the review I will give a short introduction to [CA-1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XT94iw0TpKjK2c1hXhCj8wPPOwogTVME0hsONbEf4F4/edit?usp=sharing), which is what you all have to focus on for the rest of the week.
