## Part-2

### Add a JavaScript-driven frontend to your REST-API

Continue with part-2 of the exercise "_REST, JPA, Test and CI with our start code_" where you implemented a small movie-application.
Add a simple JavaScript-driven page to the project that fetches and render data from one, or more, of your REST-endpoints.
Make sure to deploy via Travis and not manually.
